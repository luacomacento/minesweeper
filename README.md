## Minesweeper :bomb:

<img src="./preview.gif">

## About:
<p>This was a simple game I made as a personal project (yes, I used to love playing minesweeper on Windows XP) to test my Javascript skills.</p>
<p>The game was made entirely with HTML, CSS and pure Javascript (no frameworks allowed here!) and it features three gaming levels:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Easy:</b> 9x9 grid / 12 bombs</li>
  <li><b>Medium:</b> 16x16 grid / 40 bombs</li>
  <li><b>Hard:</b> 30x16 (or 16x30) grid / 76 bombs</li>
</ul>

<b>Commands:</b>
<ul>
  <li><b>Left-click/single touch:</b> opens block.</li>
  <li><b>Right-click/long touch:</b> places flag.</li>
</ul>

<p>The game works nicely on mobile (tested only on Android), but I recommend using Chrome browser to play it.</p>

## Tools:
<ul>
  <li>HTML5</li>
  <li>CSS3</li>
  <li>JavaScript ES6</li>
</ul>

## In works:
<p>Currently I am not actively working on this project. However, I would like to add the possibility for entirely custom boards, 
where the user defines how many tiles and how many bombs they want to play with.</p>
<p>I also plan on creating a mini tutorial for those who don't know how to play Minesweeper. But for the time being, just Google it! :)</p>
